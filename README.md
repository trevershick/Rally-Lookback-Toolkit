# Rally Lookback API Toolkit #

This toolkit provides an interface for interacting with Rally's Lookback API. Documentation for Rally's Lookback API can be found [here](https://rally1.rallydev.com/analytics/doc)

Maven Central Repository support coming soon. To use this toolkit in your project, clone the repository and run ```mvn package```. The .jar will be built in the target/ directory and all dependencies will be located in the target/dependency directory.

To get started, create an instance of LookbackApi and configure it with your Rally credentials and workspace information:

    LookbackApi lookbackApi = new LookbackApi();
    lookbackApi.setCredentials("myusername", "mypassword");
    lookbackApi.setWorkspace("myworkspace");

Next, ask the LookbackApi object for a new query:

    LookbackQuery query = lookbackApi.newSnapshotQuery();

The LookbackQuery object provides functions for setting up the parameters to your query.

Add query clauses with `query.addFindClause(field, value)`. To query for Defects in a project, add two clauses to the query:

    query.addFindClause("_TypeHierarchy", "Defect");
    query.addFindClause("Project", 1234); // replace 1234 with your project OID.

Find clauses can also be complex, simply build up representational objects and then add them as clauses:

    Map greaterThanInProgress = new HashMap();
    greaterThanInProgress.put("$gt", "In-Progress");
    query.addFindClause("ScheduleState", greaterThanInProgress);

LookbackQuery also provides for modifying all of the other aspects of a query, such as pagesize, start, fields, sort, and hydration. All of the objects in the toolkit support chaining for easier specification:

    query.setPagesize(200)                      // set pagesize to 200 instead of the default 20k
            .setStart(200)                      // ask for the second page of data
            .requireFields("ScheduleState",     // A useful set of fields for defects, add any others you may want
                           "ObjectID",
                           "PlanEstimate",
                           "_ValidFrom",
                           "_ValidTo")
            .sortBy("_ValidFrom")               // _ValidFrom is a useful way to order snapshots, it's also the default, so this is unnecessary
            .hydrateFields("ScheduleState");    // ScheduleState will come back as an OID if it doesn't get hydrated



Once the query is configured it can be executed via `query.execute()` which returns a LookbackResult containing the snapshot data:

    LookbackResult resultSet = query.execute();

If anything goes wrong with executing the query, such as an authentication exception, a LookbackException will be raised, which is a runtime exception. Any errors returned by the Lookback API will also be raised as runtime exceptions. The Lookback API will return warnings for certain issues that don't stop the request. The LookbackResult contains these warnings, and they can be checked for:

    if (resultSet.hasWarnings()) {
        // check warnings
    }

The data in a LookbackResult can be accessed directly via it's fields, or via an iterator:

    int resultCount = resultSet.Results.size();
    Map firstSnapshot = resultSet.Results.get(0);

    Iterator iterator = resultSet.getResultsIterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Map snapshot = iterator.next();
    }

A LookbackResult can also tell if there are more pages of data available and the LookbackApi object can automatically generate queries for the next page of a result set:

    while (resultSet.hasMorePages()) {
        LookbackQuery nextQuery = lookbackApi.getQueryForNextPage(resultSet);
        LookbackResult moreResults = nextQuery.execute();
        doSomethingWithSnapshots(moreResults);
    }

Due to the chained nature of the api, one off queries can be made all in one go:

    Iterator resultIterator =
        new LookbackApi()
            .setCredentials(username, password)
            .setWorkspace(workspace)
            .newSnapshotQuery()
                .addFindClause("_TypeHierarchy", -51038)
                .addFindClause("Children", null)
                .addFindClause("_ItemHierarchy", new BigInteger("5103028089"))
                .execute()
                    .getResultsIterator();

One quirk in dealing with Rally data from Java is dealing with OIDs, which are integers, but mcuh larger than Java's max size for integers. The BigInteger class as illustrated in the above example is an easy way to work around this issue.

## Configuring a Proxy Server ##

The following example uses a proxy server with basic authentication.

    LookbackApi api = new LookbackApi()
                .setProxyServer("http://myproxy:8080")
                .setProxyCredentials(proxyuser, proxypass)
                ...

## Advanced Configuration of the HTTP Client ##

```LookbackApi``` exposes a constructor that allows you to inject your own HttpClient instance fully configured however you would like.  The following example shows the same proxy setup as above but through explicit HttpClient configuration.

        DefaultHttpClient c = new DefaultHttpClient();
        c.getCredentialsProvider().setCredentials(new AuthScope(proxyHost, listeningPort()), new UsernamePasswordCredentials(proxyuser, proxypass));
        c.getCredentialsProvider().setCredentials(new AuthScope(serverHost, serverPort), new UsernamePasswordCredentials(username, password));
        c.getParams().setParameter(ConnRoutePNames.DEFAULT_PROXY, new HttpHost(proxyHost, listeningPort()));

        LookbackApi a = new LookbackApi(c)
                .setServer("http://" + serverHost)
                .setWorkspace(workspace);
